# 2. Clear browser cache
# 3. Logout and login again
# 4. Check you're logged in as school admin (not regular user)
```

### Verify you're a school admin:
```bash
./venv/bin/python manage.py shell -c "
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
u = User.objects.get(username='YOUR_USERNAME')
print(f'Username: {u.username}')
print(f'Is School Admin: {u.is_school_admin}')
print(f'School: {u.school}')
print(f'Is Staff: {u.is_staff}')
"

# Should show:
# Is School Admin: True
# Is Staff: True
# School: <Your School Name>
```

### Still having issues?
1. Check terminal for errors
2. Verify you created the user via `/superadmin/`
3. Make sure `is_school_admin=True` and `is_staff=True`
